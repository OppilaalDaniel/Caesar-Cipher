In cryptography "Caesar Cipher"  is one of the most simplest and widely known encryption technique.
It is also known as "Shift Cipher" as it shifts either left or right based on the key.
This method is used to encrypt the simple plain text.
It is named after Julius Caesar who used it in his times.

It consistes of three parts in general. They are
1. Plain text (the original message without encryption)
2. Key (the number or password which is used to find the crypted message)
3. Cipher text (the encrypted message)

In this method,
1. First we assign numbers to the alphabets starting from either 0 or 1 according to our interest.
a b c d e f g h i j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

2. Then we also provide the key/password which is usually a number which is used to encrypt the mesage.
if for example: key =2 (right shift)

3. Now for an instance lets take a plain text alphabet q
it is provided with the number 16
according to the key given to us we have to shift it 2 positions right
we will bw getting (16+2)=18 which is "s" --> the cipher text.

we also have formulas to encrypt amd decrypt the text given to us
c= (x+n) mod 26
c= (x-n) mod 26
where,
c - is the place value of encrypted letter
n - is the key/passowrd which denotes how much places we shouls shift left or right
x - place value of the actual letter
